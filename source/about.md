Hi, I'm Sarah Spear and I live in Austin, TX. 

I'm a full stack software engineer.

I'm an interdisciplinary leader with experience overseeing leadership, technical & technically adjacent teams. I have strong knowledge of tech entrepreneurship, having evaluated early-stage companies from multiple industries located around the globe for investment and mentorship. And I'm a trained communicator and evangelist for global organizations to local initiatives.

I'm also a comedy writer and actor.
